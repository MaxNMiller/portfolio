# CIE Reigns

During my internship at CIE, I led the development of CIE Reigns, an interactive simulation game inspired by the popular title "Reigns".

## Key achievements:

- Developed the core game mechanics using Unity and C#
- Implemented a dynamic event system with branching narratives
- Created an intuitive card-swiping interface
- Collaborated with the design team to create engaging scenarios

The project was used for internal training and later adapted for public educational purposes.
