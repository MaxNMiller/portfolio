# Pixel Adventure

Pixel Adventure is a retro-style 2D platformer featuring procedurally generated levels and pixel art graphics.

## Technical highlights:

- Developed using the Godot Engine and GDScript
- Implemented procedural level generation algorithms
- Created pixel art assets and animations
- Designed challenging gameplay mechanics

This personal project allowed me to explore procedural content generation while paying homage to classic platformers.
