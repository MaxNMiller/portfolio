# Unsent

I started my time at SlimeWare as the leader of a small programming team building a prototype for what would become Unsent, a 3D platformer developed in Unreal Engine. The success of this prototype was instrumental in securing our initial funding and laid the foundation for the company's growth. I now serve as a co-founder of the company, where I continue developing Unsent while also providing technical consultation to SlimeWare and its business partners.

## My responsibilities included:

- Implementing core gameplay mechanics using C++ and Unreal Blueprint
- Designing and optimizing the dialogue system
- Collaborating with artists and writers to bring the story to life
- Managing a small team of developers

The game received positive reviews for its innovative storytelling approach and polished gameplay experience.
