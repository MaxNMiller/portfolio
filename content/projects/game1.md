# Overview

I started my time at **SlimeWare** as the leader of a small programming team building a prototype for what would become *Unsent*, a 3D platformer developed in Unreal Engine. The success of this prototype was instrumental in securing our initial funding and laid the foundation for the company’s growth. I now serve as a **co-founder** of the company, where I continue developing *Unsent* while also providing technical consultation to SlimeWare and its business partners.
