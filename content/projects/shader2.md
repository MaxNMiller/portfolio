# Audio Based Glitch Shader

A shader that procedurally distorts meshes based on audio volume and frequency data.

## Technical details:

- Created using HLSL in Unity's shader graph system
- Implemented real-time audio analysis to drive visual effects
- Developed custom vertex displacement algorithms for various glitch effects
- Optimized for performance in VR applications

The shader creates dynamic visual distortions that react to music and sound effects, enhancing immersion in interactive experiences.
