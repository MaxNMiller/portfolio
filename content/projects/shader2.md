# Audio Based Glitch Shader

A shader that procedurally distorts meshes based on audio volume and frequency data.

## Technical features:

- Developed custom HLSL shaders that respond to real-time audio input
- Created a system to analyze audio frequency bands and translate them to visual effects
- Implemented vertex displacement techniques for organic distortion effects
- Optimized for real-time performance in Unity

This project bridges audio and visual domains, creating dynamic and responsive visual experiences driven by sound.
